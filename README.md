# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
This repository is a comprehensive collection of implementations and explanations of various data structures and algorithms in different programming languages. Whether you're a beginner looking to strengthen your foundation or an experienced developer aiming to refresh your knowledge, this repository has something for everyone.

Data structures are the way we are able to store and retrieve data. Youâ€™re already familiar with Python lists and dictionaries, so you know that lists and arrays are sequential with data accessed by index while dictionaries and objects use a named key to store and retrieve information.

Data structures handle four main functions for us:
- Inputting information
- Processing information
- Maintaining information
- Retrieving information

Simply put, algorithms are instructions that the computer follows to carry out tasks. There are many, many types of algorithms, but some common ones that you will encounter in this course (and likely the world!) are:

- Sorting algorithms
- Search algorithms
- Divide and conquer algorithms
- Greedy algorithms
- Brute force algorithms
